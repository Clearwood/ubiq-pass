# Intro

Let me start with some numbers

- 266.073 confirmed cases
- 11.184 deaths
- 182 countries, areas or territories with cases

This is Novel Corona virus, also know as COVID-19.

One of the most effective way to fight COVID-19 is to isolation.

Isolation is effective but it does not scale an given the big number of affected countries, areas or territories is sometimes hard to achieve.

The efficient way to efficient way to apply measures is the one based on data.

# Intro ubiQ-hp

Imagine that you can demonstrate your health history, whenever it is needed, accurate and 100% reliable. This kind of information, specially when they are accurate and reliable can advantage you and your environment in a lot of situations.

In a very simplistically way your health is just a simple series of events, chronological ordered.

Let's presume that you able to register this events and make them available, as they are needed, such collection of events is named health ledger.

This is what the ubique health pass provides.

An everywhere available, accurate and 100% reliable heath history. You are fully in control of your data, and nobody own the the registry or ledger.

Now try to imagine how you can fight with COVID-19 when you have accurate information about the each person that you interact. Try to imagine how efficient can apply measures when you know with what you are dealing.

# How this works

Let try to see how the solution works.

User Michael was not exposed to the virus and he decide to try the **ubique health pass**. Initially his ledger is empty. By using the distributed health ledger Michael hopes that he can travel to his relatives in the next region.

Because of the wild spread of the COVID-19 some regions have special state and in this case Michael health status need to be proven. The actual health ledger is empty the safes measure will be to avoid the traveling. The health check is done in the moment when Michael tries to enter in the next region. The control is executed by specialized personal and Michael acknowledge the access to the his health ledger. Without Michael access, **nobody** can interact with his health ledger.

After a few days, Michael get exposed to the COVID-19 and start to fill ill. He contacts a specials of his choice and he gets the confirmation for the COVID-19 infection. In this case both parts the patient and the specials agree upon the health event and this event is be register in the distributed health ledger. Here is worthy to mention that the specialist digital signs the corresponding entry in the health ledger. This action make his decision verifiable and traceable.

After a week Michael feels better and visits again his preferred specialist. The specialist confirms that Michael is healthy and add a new event to Michael's health record.

Now, Michael is completely restored and he will like visit his relatives in the next region. As before the its health status is proven but now the two previous events are visible and the specialized personal can apply the proper measures - by allowing him to travel. More, to eliminate any sing of suspicion all the details related to event are proven. This because each event is traceable and verifiable.

# Impact

- Michael can prove this health history, whenever it is needed, accurate and 100% reliable.
- Any other entities (as specialized personal) can make use of this information, for limited amount of time and _only_ if the action is acknowledged by the data owner.
- The solution supports a high degree of automation.

## Things to notice

- Michael does not use explicit any kind of device - the interaction with the ledger can be done from a lot of devices (from smart phone to dedicated or embed devices), same logic for the specified personal.
- Michael has _complete control_ over his data. He acknowledge the interaction with the health ledger, when this is needed.
- Even is Michael own his data, he can not alter after his own wish. All the valid events are digital signed by a specialist - otherwise are not valid events.
- _!Nobody!_ owns the ledger and nobody can influence (or control) its behavior.

# Scalability

- The above described scenario is purposed focused on COVID-19, from obvious reason but its scope can be easily extended.
- The solution can server a large amount of users.
- The solution can be limited to a region/country but in the same way you can use it across borders.

# Etc

The solution is based on blockchain. For more technical, details please consider the README.MD
